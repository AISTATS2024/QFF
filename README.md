# Quantized Fourier and Polynomial Features for more Expressive Tensor Network Models

This repository allows for the reproduction of the numerical experiments in Quantized Fourier and Polynomial Features for more Expressive Tensor Network Models. 

## Requirements

The sound dataset can be downloaded from the [webpage of Andrew Wilson](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/andrew/pattern/#Data)

All UCI datasets can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY)

The airline dataset can be downloaded from https://sendgb.com/Jx4t8qZsezD

## Training and Evaluation

To train and test the models in the paper on the various datasets, it is sufficient to execute the corresponding homonymous scripts.
